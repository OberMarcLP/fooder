## Code Style Guidelines

### Go (Backend)

- Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go)
- Use `gofmt` for formatting
- Run `go vet` before committing
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for exported functions
- Handle errors properly

**Example:**

```go
// GetRestaurant retrieves a restaurant by ID
func GetRestaurant(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    vars := mux.Vars(r)
    id, err := strconv.Atoi(vars["id"])
    if err != nil {
        http.Error(w, "Invalid restaurant ID", http.StatusBadRequest)
        return
    }

    // ... implementation
}
```

### TypeScript/React (Frontend)

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and reusable
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Add prop types/interfaces

**Example:**

```typescript
interface RestaurantCardProps {
  restaurant: Restaurant;
  onEdit?: () => void;
  onDelete?: () => void;
}

export const RestaurantCard: React.FC<RestaurantCardProps> = ({
  restaurant,
  onEdit,
  onDelete,
}) => {
  // ... implementation
};
```

### General Guidelines

- **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself
- **KISS**: Keep It Simple, Stupid
- **YAGNI**: You Aren't Gonna Need It
- Write self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep lines under 100 characters
- Add blank lines for readability

## Testing Guidelines

### Backend Tests

```go
func TestGetRestaurant(t *testing.T) {
    // Setup
    db := setupTestDB(t)
    defer db.Close()

    // Test case
    restaurant := createTestRestaurant(t, db)

    // Execute
    result, err := GetRestaurantByID(db, restaurant.ID)

    // Assert
    assert.NoError(t, err)
    assert.Equal(t, restaurant.Name, result.Name)
}
```

### Frontend Tests

```typescript
describe('RestaurantCard', () => {
  it('renders restaurant information', () => {
    const restaurant = createMockRestaurant();
    render(<RestaurantCard restaurant={restaurant} />);

    expect(screen.getByText(restaurant.name)).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText(restaurant.address)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### Test Requirements

- **Coverage**: Aim for >80% code coverage
- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions
- **Integration tests**: Test component interactions
- **E2E tests**: Test critical user flows (optional)

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add comments for exported functions
- Document complex algorithms
- Explain "why" not just "what"
- Keep documentation up to date

### User Documentation

- Update README.md if needed
- Add to docs/ folder for major features
- Include examples and screenshots
- Keep language clear and simple

## Review Process

2. **Tests**: Are there adequate tests?
3. **Performance**: Any performance concerns?
4. **Security**: Any security issues?
