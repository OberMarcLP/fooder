## Emergency Procedures

### Service Down
```bash
# Check service status
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps

# View logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f

# Restart specific service
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart backend

# Restart all services
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart
```

### Database Issues
```bash
# Access database
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec db psql -U nomdb nomdb

# Check connections
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec db psql -U nomdb -c \
  "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'nomdb';"

# Restore from backup
./scripts/restore.sh backups/backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql.gz
```

### SSL Certificate Expired
```bash
# Renew certificate
sudo certbot renew

# Copy new certificates
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem nginx/ssl/
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem nginx/ssl/

# Restart nginx
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart nginx
```

### Out of Disk Space
```bash
# Check disk usage
df -h

# Clean up Docker
docker system prune -a --volumes

# Remove old backups
find backups/ -name "backup_*.sql.gz" -mtime +30 -delete

# Check log sizes
du -sh /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log
```
