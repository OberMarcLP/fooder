# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

This guide walks you through setting up your GitHub repository with best practices, including branch protection, GitHub Pages, and automated Docker image publishing.

## Initial Repository Setup

### 1. Create Repository on GitHub

```bash
# If you haven't already, create a new repository on GitHub
# Then push your local code:

git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/the-nom-database.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Create Develop Branch

```bash
# Create and push develop branch
git checkout -b develop
git push -u origin develop

# Set develop as default branch in GitHub Settings (optional but recommended)
```

## Branch Protection Rules

### Setting Up Branch Protection

1. Go to **Settings** → **Branches** → **Add branch protection rule**

### Protection for `main` Branch

**Branch name pattern:** `main`

**Settings:**
- ✅ **Require a pull request before merging**
  - ✅ Require approvals: **1**
  - ✅ Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
  - ✅ Require review from Code Owners (if you have CODEOWNERS file)

- ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
  - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - **Required checks:**
    - `test-backend`
    - `test-frontend`
    - `security-scan`
    - `build-and-push / build-and-push (backend)`
    - `build-and-push / build-and-push (frontend)`

- ✅ **Require conversation resolution before merging**

- ✅ **Require signed commits** (optional but recommended)

- ✅ **Require linear history** (optional)

- ✅ **Do not allow bypassing the above settings**

- ❌ **Allow force pushes** (disabled)

- ❌ **Allow deletions** (disabled)

### Protection for `develop` Branch

**Branch name pattern:** `develop`

**Settings:**
- ✅ **Require a pull request before merging**
  - ✅ Require approvals: **1**

- ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
  - **Required checks:**
    - `test-backend`
    - `test-frontend`

- ✅ **Require conversation resolution before merging**

- ⚠️ **Allow force pushes**
  - Only for administrators (for occasional rebasing)

- ❌ **Allow deletions** (disabled)

## GitHub Pages Setup

### Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**

2. **Source:**
   - Select: **GitHub Actions**

3. The workflow `.github/workflows/pages.yml` will automatically deploy docs

4. **Custom domain** (optional):
   - Add your custom domain
   - Configure DNS with CNAME record

5. **Enforce HTTPS**: ✅ Enabled

### Verify Deployment

After pushing to main:
- Check **Actions** tab for "Deploy GitHub Pages" workflow
- Visit: `https://your-username.github.io/the-nom-database`

## GitHub Container Registry Setup

### Enable Packages

GitHub Packages is automatically enabled. Docker images will be published to:
- `ghcr.io/your-username/the-nom-database/backend`
- `ghcr.io/your-username/the-nom-database/frontend`

### Make Images Public (Recommended)

1. Go to **Packages** (from your profile or repository)
2. Click on `backend` package
3. **Package settings** → **Change visibility** → **Public**
4. Repeat for `frontend` package

### Pull Images Without Authentication

Once public, anyone can pull:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/your-username/the-nom-database/backend:latest
docker pull ghcr.io/your-username/the-nom-database/frontend:latest
```

## Repository Settings

4. **Merge button:**
   - Default to: **Squash and merge**

### Security Settings

1. Go to **Settings** → **Code security and analysis**

2. **Dependency graph:** ✅ Enabled

3. **Dependabot:**
   - ✅ Dependabot alerts
   - ✅ Dependabot security updates

4. **Code scanning:**
   - ✅ CodeQL analysis (optional)

2. **Actions permissions:**
   - ✅ Allow all actions and reusable workflows

3. **Workflow permissions:**
   - ✅ Read and write permissions
   - ✅ Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests

4. **Fork pull request workflows:**
   - ⚠️ Require approval for first-time contributors

## Environment Secrets

### Add Repository Secrets

Go to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** → **New repository secret**

**Optional secrets for CI/CD:**
